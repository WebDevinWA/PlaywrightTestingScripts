# Page Object Model (POM)

The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation for web applications. It helps to create an abstraction layer between the tests and the web UI, allowing for better organization, maintainability, and reusability of test code. The main idea behind the Page Object Model is to represent each web page or component as a separate class, encapsulating the functionality and elements of that page.

## Key Components and Principles

### Page Classes
Each web page or component in the application has its own corresponding class, often referred to as a "Page Object." This class encapsulates all the actions and elements related to that page. For example, if you have a login page, you would create a `LoginPage` class that contains methods for entering the username, password, clicking the login button, etc.

### Methods
Page Object classes contain methods to interact with the elements on the page. These methods should represent the user interactions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and retrieving information from the page.

### Element Locators
Page Object classes also define element locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath expressions) for each web element on the page. These locators are used by the methods to interact with the elements.

### Separation of Concerns
POM promotes the separation of concerns by keeping the test logic separate from the implementation details of the UI. Tests interact with the application solely through the methods provided by the Page Objects, without needing to know the intricacies of the HTML structure or element locators.

### Reusable Components
Page Object classes can be reused across multiple tests. If there are changes to the UI, only the corresponding Page Object class needs to be updated, rather than updating multiple test cases.

### Maintenance
POM makes maintenance easier since changes in the UI can be localized to the affected Page Object classes. This reduces the risk of code duplication and makes it simpler to maintain and scale automated test suites.

## Summary
The Page Object Model methodology is a systematic approach to organizing and managing automated tests for web applications. It focuses on creating reusable, maintainable, and easily understandable test code by abstracting the UI components into separate classes.
